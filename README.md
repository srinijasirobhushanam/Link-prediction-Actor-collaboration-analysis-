Project Abstract

Given a snapshot of actor network, can we able to predict new actor collaborations in the near future?
This is basically a link prediction problem and develop various approaches to predict based on the
measures for analyzing the future collaborations in the actor network. Many of the study was done on
the co-authorship networks which suggest that the interactions information about future can be extracted
from the network topology alone and the important measures for detecting the node proximity can
outperform direct measures.
